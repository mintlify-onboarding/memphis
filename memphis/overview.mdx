### What is Memphis{dev}?

**Memphis** is a next-generation alternative to traditional message brokers.

A simple, robust, and durable cloud-native message broker wrapped with an entire ecosystem that enables cost-effective, fast, and reliable development of modern queue-based use cases.

Memphis enables the building of modern queue-based applications that require large volumes of streamed and enriched data, modern protocols, zero ops, rapid development, extreme cost reduction, and a significantly lower amount of dev time for data-oriented developers and data engineers.

**Memphis focuses on four pillars.**

1. 1.  
Stability - Queues and brokers play a critical part in the modern application's structure and should be highly available and stable as possible.

2. 2.  
Performance and Efficiency - Provide good performance while maintaining efficient resource consumption.

3. 3.  
Observability - Reduces troubleshooting time to near zero.

4. 4.  
Developer Experience - Rapid Development, Modularity, inline processing, Schema management.

### What struggles does Memphis solve?

1. 1.  
Too many data sources become too complicated to handle.

2. 2.  
Different and complex schemas get in the way.

3. 3.  
It isn't easy to transform schema and analyze streamed data per source.

4. 4.  
Currently, stream processing requires stitching multiple applications together, like Apache Kafka, Flink, and NiFi. Real-time becomes near-real-time or far-real-time.

5. 5.  
Loss of messages due to lack of retransmits, crashes, and monitoring.

6. 6.  
The event's journey is challenging to debug and troubleshoot.

7. 7.  
Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, and other MQs are HARD to deploy, manage, secure, update, onboard, and tune.

8. 8.  
Turning batch processes into real-time can be complicated and time-consuming.
