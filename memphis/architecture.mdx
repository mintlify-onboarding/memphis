## Connectivity Diagram

Memphis deployment comprised four components:

**1.** GUI - The dashboard of Memphis.

**2.** Broker (or brokers in cluster mode)

**3.** MongoDB - Only for UI state persistency (not used for storing messages).
Will be replaced in the coming versions.

MongoDB is not for data traffic but rather responsible for UI state and metadata
only and will be removed soon.

## Ordering

Ordering is guaranteed only while working with a single consumer group.

## Mirroring

Memphis is designed to run as a distributed cluster for a highly available and
scalable system. The consensus algorithm responsible for atomicity within
Memphis, called RAFT, and compared to Apache ZooKeeper, widely used by other
projects like Kafka, does not require a witness or a standalone Quorum. RAFT is
also equivalent to Paxos in fault tolerance and performance.

To ensure data consistency and zero loss within complete broker’s restarts,
Memphis brokers should run on different nodes and try to do it automatically. To
comply with RAFT requirements which are ½ cluster size + 1, On K8S environment,
three Memphis brokers will be deployed. The minimum number of brokers is three
to ensure at least one node failure.

## Delivery Guarantee

- At least once

This is achieved by the combination of published messages being persisted to the
station as well as the consumer tracking delivery and acknowledgment of each
message as clients receive and process them.

- [Exactly once (Idempotence)](/memphis/concepts/idempotency)
