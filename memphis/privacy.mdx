  "For our engineering team to track and resolve bugs in real-time and our
  product team to understand which feature is more required or did not build
  right, Memphis collects anonymous metadata only."

### Why?

We are constantly exploring and researching how to build the best dev-product we
can with value, features, and capabilities built by our users' requests and
because we are open-sourced first. It means that we are almost entirely "blind"
to understand what our users like or not. **That is the only reason we are
collecting anonymous metadata.**

### Which metrics does Memphis collect?
