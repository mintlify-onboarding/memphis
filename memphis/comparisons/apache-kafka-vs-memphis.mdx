## What is Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform. Based on
the abstraction of a distributed commit log, Kafka can handle a great number of
events with functionality comprising pub/sub.

## What is Memphis.dev?

**Memphis** is a next-generation message broker.

A simple, robust, and durable cloud-native message broker wrapped with an entire
ecosystem that enables fast and reliable development of next-generation
event-driven use cases.

Memphis.dev enables building next-generation applications that require large
volumes of streamed and enriched data, modern protocols, zero ops, rapid
development, extreme cost reduction, and a significantly lower amount of dev
time for data-oriented developers and data engineers.

## General

| Parameter                 | Memphis.dev                              | Apache Kafka                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| License                   | Apache 2.0                               | Apache 2.0                             |
| Components                | Memphis + MongoDB (MDB is being removed) | Kafka + Zookeeper(ZK is being removed) |
| Message consumption model | Pull                                     | Pull                                   |
| Storage architecture      | Log                                      | Log                                    |

### License

Both technologies are available under fully open-source licenses. Memphis also
has a commercial distribution with added security, tiered storage, and more.

### Components

Kafka uses Apache Zookeeper™ for consensus and message storage. Memphis uses
MongoDB for GUI state management only and will be removed soon, making Memphis
without any external dependency. Memphis achieves consensus by using RAFT.

### Message Consumption Model

Both Kafka and Memphis use a pull-based architecture where consumers pull
messages from the server, and
[long-polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%5Ftechnology#Long%5Fpolling)
is used to ensure new messages are made available instantaneously.

Pull-based architectures are often preferable for high throughput workloads as
they allow consumers to manage their flow control, fetching only what they need.

### Storage Architecture

Kafka uses a distributed commit log as its storage layer. Writes are appended to
the end of the log. Reads are sequential, starting from an offset, and data is
zero-copied from the disk buffer to the network buffer. This works well for
event streaming use cases.

Memphis also uses a distributed commit log called streams (made by NATS
Jetstream) as its storage layer, which can be written entirely on the broker's
(server) memory or disk. Memphis also uses offsets but abstracts them
completely, so the heavy lifting of saving a record of the used offsets resides
on Memphis and not on the client. Memphis also offers storage tiering for
offloading messages to S3-compatible storage for an infinite storage time and
more cost-effective storage. Reads are sequential.

| Storage balancing                    | Automatic based on policy | Manual                                 |

### Deployment

Kafka is a cluster-based technology with a medium-weight architecture requiring
two distributed components: Kafka's own servers (brokers) plus ZooKeeper™
servers. Zookeeper adds an additional level of complexity but the community is
in the process of removing the ZooKeeper component from Kafka. Kafka "Vanilla"
deployment requires a manual binary installation and text-based configuration,
as well as config OS daemons and internal parameters.

Memphis has a light-weight yet robust cloud-native architecture and packed as a
container from day one. It can be deployed using any docker engine, docker
swarm, and for production environment using helm for Kubernetes (soon with
operator). Memphis initial config is already sufficient for production, and
optimizations can take place on-the-fly without downtime. That approach enables
Memphis to be completely isolated and apart from the infrastructure it deployed
upon.

### Enterprise support and managed cloud offering

Enterprise-grade support and managed cloud offerings for Kafka are available
from several prominent vendors, including Confluent, AWS (MSK), Cloudera, and
more.

Memphis provides enterprise support and managed cloud offering that includes
features like enhanced security, stream research abilities, an ML-based resource
scheduler for better cost savings, and more.

### Self-healing

Kafka is a robust distributed system and requires constant tune-ups, client-made
wrappers, management, and tight monitoring. The user or operator is responsible
for ensuring it's alive and works as required. This approach has pros and cons,
as the user can tune almost every parameter, which is often revealed as a
significant burden.

One of Memphis' core features is to remove frictions of management and
autonomously make sure it's alive and performing well using periodic self-checks
and proactive rebalancing tasks, as well as fencing the users from misusing the
system. In parallel, every aspect of the system can be configured on-the-fly
without downtime.

### Notifications

Memphis has a built-in notification center that can push real-time alerts based
on defined triggers like client disconnections, resource depletion, schema
violation, and more.

![](/memphis/comparisons/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-12-22%20at%2014.26.36.png)

Apache Kafka does not offer an embedded solution for notifications. Can be
achieved via commercial offerings.

### Message tracing (aka Stream lineage)

Tracking stream lineage is the ability to understand the full path of a message
from the very first producer through the final consumer, including the trail and
evolvement of a message between topics. This ability is extremely handy in a
troubleshooting process.

Apache Kafka does not provide a native ability for stream lineage, but it can be
achieved using OpenTelemetry or OpenLineage frameworks, as well as integrating
3rd party applications such as datadog, epsagon, or using Confluent's cloud
offering.

Memphis provides stream lineage per message with out-of-the-box visualization
for each stamped message using a generated header by the Memphis SDK.

| Geo-Replication (Multi-region) | Yes                         | Yes                         |

### Mirroring (Replication)

Kafka Replication means having multiple copies of the data spread across
multiple servers/brokers. This helps maintain high availability if one of the
brokers goes down and is unavailable to serve the requests.

Memphis station replication works similarly. During station (=topic) creation,
the user can choose the number of replicas derived from the number of available
brokers. messages will be replicated in a raid-1 manner across the chosen number
of brokers.

### Multi-tenancy

Multi-tenancy refers to the mode of operation of software where multiple
independent instances of one or multiple applications operate in a shared
environment. The instances (tenants) are logically isolated and often physically
integrated. The most famous users are SaaS-type applications.

Apache Kafka does not natively support multi-tenancy. It can be achieved via
complex client logic, different topics, and ACL.

As Memphis pushes to enable the next generation of applications and especially
SaaS-type architectures, Memphis supports Multi-tenancy across all the layers
from stations (=topics) to security, consumers, and producers, all the way to
node selection for complete hardware isolation in case of need. It is enabled
using namespaces and can be managed in a unified console.

### Storage tiering

Memphis offers a multi-tier storage strategy in its open-source version. Memphis
will write messages that reached their end of 1st retention policy to a 2nd
retention policy on object storage like S3 for longer retention time,
potentially infinite, and post-streaming analysis. This feature can
significantly help with cost reduction and stream auditing.

### Permanent storage

Both Kafka and Memphis store data durably and reliably, much like a normal
database. Data retention is user configurable per Memphis station or Kafka
topic.

### Idempotency

Both Kafka and Memphis provide default support in idempotent producers. On the
consumer side, in Kafka, it׳s the client's responsibility to build a retry
mechanism that will retransmit a batch of messages exactly once, while in
Memphis, it is provided natively within the SDK with a parameter called
`maxMsgDeliveries`.

### Geo-Replication (Multi-region)

Common scenarios for a geo-replication include:

- Geo-replication

- Disaster recovery

- Feeding edge clusters into a central, aggregate cluster

- Physical isolation of clusters (such as production vs. testing)

- Cloud migration or hybrid cloud deployments

- Legal and compliance requirements

Kafka users can set up such inter-cluster data flows with Kafka's MirrorMaker
(version 2), a tool to replicate data between different Kafka environments in a
streaming manner.

Memphis cloud users can create more Memphis clusters and form a supercluster
that replicates data in an async manner between the clusters of streamed data,
security, consumer groups, unified management, and more.

### GUI

Multiple open-source GUIs have been developed for Kafka over the years, for
example, [Kafka-UI](https://github.com/provectus/kafka-ui). Usually, it cannot
sustain heavy traffic and visualization and requires separate computing and
maintenance. There are different commercial versions of Kafka that, among the
rest, provide robust GUI, like Confluent, Conduktor, and more.

Memphis provides a native state-of-the-art GUI, hosted inside the broker, built
to act as a management layer of all Memphis aspects, including cluster config,
resources, data observability, notifications, processing, and more.

### Dead-letter Queue

Dead-letter queue is both a concept and a solution that is useful for debugging
clients because it lets you isolate and "recycle" instead of drop unconsumed
messages to determine why their processing doesn't succeed.

The Kafka architecture does not support DLQ within the broker; it is the client
or consumer's responsibility to implement such behavior for good and bad.

One of Memphis' core building blocks is avoiding unexpected data loss, enabling
rapid development, and shortening troubleshooting cycles. Therefore, memphis
provides a native solution for dead-letter that acts as the station recycle bin
for various failures such as unacknowledged messages, schema violations, and
custom exceptions.

### Schema Management

The very basic building block to control and ensure the quality of data that
flows through your organization between the different owners is by defining
well-written schemas and data models.

Confluent offers "Schema Registry" which is a standalone component and provides
a centralized repository for schemas and metadata, allowing services to flexibly
interact and exchange data with each other without the challenge of managing and
sharing schemas between them. It requires dedicated management, maintenance,
scale, and monitoring.

As part of its open-source version, Memphis presents Schemaverse, which is also
embedded within the broker. Schemaverse provides a robust schema store and
schema management layer on top of memphis broker without a standalone compute or
dedicated resources. With a unique and modern UI and programmatic approach,
technical and non-technical users can create and define different schemas,
attach the schema to multiple stations and choose if the schema should be
enforced or not. In counter to Schema Registry, the client does not need to
implement serialization functions, and every schema update takes place during
producers' runtime.

![Schemaverse](/memphis/comparisons/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-12-24%20at%2022.32.36.png)

### Message routing

Kafka provides routing capabilities through Kafka Connect and Kafka Streams,
including content-based routing, message transformation, and message enrichment.

Memphis message routing is similar to the implementation of RabbitMQ using
routing keys, wildcards, content-based routing, and more. Similar to RabbitMQ,
it is also embedded within the broker and does not require external libraries or
tools.

### Log compaction

Compaction has been created to support a long-term, potentially infinite record
store based on specific keys.

Kafka supports native topic compaction, which runs on all brokers. This runs
automatically for compacted topics, condensing the log down to the latest
version of messages sharing the same key.

At the moment, Memphis does not support compaction, but it will in the future.

### Message replay

The ability to re-consume committed messages.

Kafka does support replay by seeking specific offsets as the consumers have
control over resetting the offset.

Memphis does not support replay yet but will in the near future (2023).

### Stream Enrichment

Kafka, with its Kafka Streams library, allows developers to implement elastic
and scalable client applications that can leverage essential stream processing
features such as tables, joins, and aggregations of several topics, and export
to multiple sources via Kafka connect.

Memphis provides a similar behavior and more. Embedded inside the broker,
Memphis users can create serverless-type functions or complete containerized
applications that aggregate several stations and streams, decorate and enrich
messages from different sources, write complex functions that cannot be achieved
via SQL, and manipulate the schema. Memphis embedded connectors frameworks will
help to push the results directly to a defined sink.

### Pull retry mechanism

In case of a failure or lack of ability to acknowledge consumed messages, there
should be a retry mechanism that will retry to pull the same offset or batch of
messages.

In Kafka, it is the client's responsibility to implement one. Some key factors
must be considered to implement such a mechanism, like blocking vs non-blocking,
offset tracking, idempotency, and more.

In Memphis, the retry mechanism is built-in and turned on by default within the
SDK and broker. During consumer creation, the parameter `maxMsgDeliveries` will
determine the number of retries the station will deliver a message if an
acknowledgment does not arrive till `maxAckTimeMs` . The broker itself records
the offsets given and will expose only the unacknowledged ones to the retry
request.

## Conclusion

Apache Kafka is a robust and mature system with extensive community support and
a proven record for high-throughput use cases and users. Still, it also requires
micro-management, troubleshooting can take precious time, complex client
implementations, wrappers, and often tunings that take the user's focus and
resources from the "main event," and the most important thing - it does not
scale well as the organization grows, and more use cases join in. Wix
[Greyhound](https://github.com/wix/greyhound) library is an excellent proof for
the needed work on top of Kafka.

We call Memphis "A next-generation message broker" because it leans towards the
user and adapts to its scale and requirements, not the opposite. Most of the
wrappers, tunings, management-overhead, and implementations needed from the
client in Kafka, are abstract to the users in Memphis, which provides an
excellent solution for both the smaller workload use cases and the more robust
ones under the same system and with full ecosystem to support it. It has a
milage to pass, but the immediate benefits already exist and will continue to
evolve.
