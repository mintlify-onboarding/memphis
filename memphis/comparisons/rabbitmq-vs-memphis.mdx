## **What is RabbitMQ?**

RabbitMQ is a lightweight and easy-to-deploy messaging queue for on-premises and
cloud environments. It supports multiple messaging protocols. RabbitMQ can be
deployed in distributed and federated configurations to meet high-scale,
high-availability requirements.

## What is Memphis.dev?

**Memphis** is a next-generation message broker.

A simple, robust, and durable cloud-native message broker wrapped with an entire
ecosystem that enables fast and reliable development of next-generation
event-driven use cases.

Memphis.dev enables building next-generation applications that require large
volumes of streamed and enriched data, modern protocols, zero ops, rapid
development, extreme cost reduction, and a significantly lower amount of dev
time for data-oriented developers and data engineers.

## General

| Parameter                 | Memphis.dev                              | RabbitMQ       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| License                   | Apache 2.0                               | Mozilla Public |
| Components                | Memphis + MongoDB (MDB is being removed) | RabbitMQ       |
| Message consumption model | Pull                                     | Push           |
| Storage architecture      | Log                                      | Index          |

### License

Both technologies are available under fully open-source licenses. Memphis also
has a commercial-based distribution with added security, tiered storage, and
more.

### Components

Memphis uses MongoDB for GUI state management only and will be removed soon,
making Memphis without any external dependency. Both Memphis and RabbitMQ
achieve consensus by using RAFT.

### Message Consumption Model

RabbitMQ uses a push-based approach synonymous with traditional messaging
systems.

Memphis uses a pull-based architecture where consumers pull messages from the
server, and
[long-polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%5Ftechnology#Long%5Fpolling)
is used to ensure new messages are made available instantaneously.

Pull-based architectures are often preferable for high throughput workloads as
they allow consumers to manage their flow control, fetching only what they need.

### Storage Architecture

RabbitMQ uses index-based storage systems. These keep data in a tree structure
to provide the fast access necessary for acknowledging individual messages.

Memphis uses a distributed commit log called streams (made by NATS Jetstream) as
its storage layer, which can be written entirely on the broker's (server) memory
or disk. Memphis abstracts the offsets by default, so saving a record of the
used offsets resides on Memphis and not on the client.

### **Data Flow**

RabbitMQ uses a distinct, bounded data flow. Messages are created and sent by
the producer and received by the consumer. Memphis uses an unbounded data flow,
with the key-value pairs continuously streaming to the assigned station.

### Data Usage

RabbitMQ is best for transactional data, such as order formation, placement, and
user requests. Memphis works great for transactional and operational data like
process operations, auditing and logging statistics, and system activity.

### **Message retention**

RabbitMQ pushes messages to consumers. These messages are removed from the queue
once they are processed and acknowledged. Memphis is a log. It uses continuous
messages, which stay in the station (queue) until the retention period expires.

### **Topology**

RabbitMQ uses the exchange queue topology — sending messages to an exchange
where they are, in turn, routed to various queue bindings for the consumer’s
use. Memphis employs the publish/subscribe topology, sending messages across the
streams to the correct stations, and then consumed by users in the different
authorized groups.

### Architecture Differences

When choosing between Memphis and RabbitMQ, the internal operations and
fundamental design can be essential considerations.

The components of RabbitMQ’s Architecture consist of the following:

- Queue: It is in charge of keeping track of messages that have been received
  and may have configuration data that specifies what it can do with a message.

- Exchange: An exchange receives messages sent to RabbitMQ and determines where
  they should be forwarded. Exchanges define the routing strategies used for
  messages, most frequently by examining the data characteristics transmitted
  with the message or included inside its attributes.

- Producer: Produces messages and sends them to a broker server (publishes). A
  payload and a label are the two components of a message. The user's desired
  data to convey is the payload. The label specifies who should receive a copy
  of the message and describes the payload.

- Consumer: It subscribes to a queue and is connected to a broker server.

- Broker: Applications can exchange information and communicate with one another
  through a broker.

- Binding: It tells an exchange which queues to distribute messages.
  Additionally, the binding will instruct the exchange to filter which messages
  it is permitted to add to a queue for specific exchange types.

Memphis architecture is designed using the following components:

- Replicas: One of the most crucial elements of Memphis is replication, which
  ensures that messages are published and consumed even when the broker
  encounters a problem.

- RAFT: It maintains data coordination between brokers such as configuration,
  location, data, and status details.

- Producer: Producers push or publish messages to a Memphis station created on a
  Memphis broker. Producers can also send messages to a broker synchronously or
  asynchronously.

- Consumers: Individuals who subscribe to a Memphis station and pull messages
  from it. Memphis allows data to be stored in additional storage platforms used
  by programs for online transaction processing (OLTP) beside internal disks and
  memory.

- Broker: Acts as a Memphis server, or broker. The number of streams for each
  message is defined in accordance with the order in which the broker stores the
  messages.

### Scalability and Redundancy

RabbitMQ uses a round-robin queue to repeat messages. The messages are divided
among the queues to boost throughput and balance the load. Additionally, it
enables numerous consumers to read messages from various queues simultaneously.

In Memphis, scalability and redundancy are provided by stream objects. The
stream is duplicated across numerous brokers. In the event that one of the
brokers fails, the data can still be served by another broker.

If data is stored in only one broker, the dependence on that broker will grow,
which is hazardous and increases the likelihood that it will fail. Additionally,
distributing the streams will vastly improve throughput.

### Multi-region/Multi-cloud

The highest availability capability in RabbitMQ is cluster and quorum queues,
which enable cross-node replication.

Besides mirroring and striping stations across multiple brokers, that can
ultimately span across AZs. Partners and Memphis cloud users can establish a
memphis super-cluster across regions in an active/passive topology.

### Multi-tenancy

**RabbitMQ** is a multi-tenant system: connections, exchanges, queues, bindings,
user permissions, policies, and some other things belong to virtual hosts, and
logical groups of entities.

![](/memphis/comparisons/images/Screen-20Shot-202022-12-22-20at-2014.10.16.png)

**Memphis** supports multi-tenancy using namespaces which offers a complete
separation from connections, producers, consumers, security, dedicated
dashboard, including node selection.

![](/memphis/comparisons/images/Screen-20Shot-202022-12-22-20at-2014.10.43.png)

### Queue striping

All data/state required for operating a RabbitMQ broker is replicated across all
nodes. An exception is message queues, which by default reside on one node,
though they are visible and reachable from all nodes. To replicate queues across
nodes in a cluster, use a queue type that supports replication. This topic is
covered in the [Quorum Queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html)
guide.

Memphis replicates data across brokers based on defined policy (Replicas).
Memphis station can also span and stripe data across brokers to achieve higher
throughput and availability.

### GUI

RabbitMQ offers a native GUI that can act as a management layer as well

![](/memphis/comparisons/images/image.png)

Memphis provides a native state-of-the-art GUI, hosted inside the broker, built
to act as a management layer of all Memphis aspects, including cluster config,
resources, data observability, notifications, processing, and more.

![](/memphis/comparisons/images/image20.png)

### Schema Management

The very basic building block to control and ensure the quality of data that
flows through your organization between the different owners is by defining
well-written schemas and data models. The benefit of schema management is for
allowing compatibility between decoupled clients.

As part of its open-source version, Memphis presents Schemaverse, which is also
embedded within the broker. Schemaverse provides a robust schema store and
schema management layer on top of memphis broker without a standalone compute or
dedicated resources. With a unique and modern UI and programmatic approach,
technical and non-technical users can create and define different schemas,
attach the schema to multiple stations and choose if the schema should be
enforced or not. In counter to Schema Registry, the client does not need to
implement serialization functions, and every schema update takes place during
producers' runtime.

### Wildcard consume

The ability to consume messages from multiple queues using a single connection.

In RabbitMQ, Messages are not published directly to a queue. Instead, the
producer sends messages to an exchange. Exchanges are message routing agents,
defined by the virtual host within RabbitMQ. An exchange is responsible for
routing the messages to different queues with the help of header attributes,
bindings, and routing keys.

Memphis currently does not support it.

### Stream Enrichment

The ability to decorate produced messages using serverless functions or SQL
statements.

RabbitMQ does not support it.

Memphis provides a similar behavior to Kafka streams and more. Embedded inside
the broker, Memphis users can create serverless-type functions or complete
containerized applications that aggregate several stations and streams, decorate
and enrich messages from different sources, write complex functions that cannot
be achieved via SQL, and manipulate the schema. Memphis embedded connectors
frameworks will help to push the results directly to a defined sink.

### Ready-to-use source/sinks connectors

Memphis offers both integrations that are compatible with NATS protocol,
Memphis-based integrations, and ready-to-use connectors that can replace
producers and consumers to and from different applications and databases made by
the community, Memphis team, and 3rd party apps.

RabbitMQ does not support it.

### Stream lineage

Tracking stream lineage is the ability to understand the full path of a message
from the very first producer through the final consumer, including the trail and
evolvement of a message between topics. This ability is extremely handy in a
troubleshooting process.

RabbitMQ does not offer stream lineage, but it can be achieved using
OpenTelemetry or OpenLineage frameworks or integrating 3rd party applications
such as Datadog and Epsagon.

Memphis provides stream lineage per message with out-of-the-box visualization
for each stamped message using a generated header by the Memphis SDK.

### Self-healing

RabbitMQ requires tune-ups, client-made wrappers, management, and tight
monitoring. The user or operator is responsible for ensuring it's alive and
works as required. This approach has pros and cons, as the user can tune almost
every parameter, which is often revealed as a significant burden.

One of Memphis' core features is to remove frictions of management and
autonomously make sure it's alive and performing well using periodic self-checks
and proactive rebalancing tasks, as well as fencing the users from misusing the
system. In parallel, every aspect of the system can be configured on-the-fly
without downtime.

### Dead-letter Queue

Dead-letter queue is both a concept and a solution that is useful for debugging
clients because it lets you isolate and "recycle" instead of drop unconsumed
messages to determine why their processing doesn't succeed.

In RabbitMQ, messages from a queue can be "dead-lettered"; that is, republished
to an exchange when any of the following events occur: a) The message is
negatively acknowledged by a consumer using basic.reject or basic.nack with
requeue parameter set to false. b) The message expires due to per-message TTL.
c) The message is dropped because its queue exceeded a length limit.

One of Memphis' core building blocks is avoiding unexpected data loss, enabling
rapid development, and shortening troubleshooting cycles. Therefore, memphis
provides a native solution for dead-letter that acts as the station recycle bin
for various failures such as unacknowledged messages, schema violations, and
custom exceptions.

### REST Gateway

To enable message production via HTTP calls for various use cases and ease of
use, Memphis added an HTTP gateway to receive REST-based requests (=messages)
and produce those messages to the required station.

RabbitMQ does not support it.

### Consumer internal communication

In some use cases, especially around microservices and streaming pipelines, it
is crucial for the different microservices to be able to communicate with each
other to sync changes, arrival of data, match data flow, etc.

Memphis is currently experimenting with creating that ability for consumers to
be able to communicate with each other using gRPC or shared channels.

RabbitMQ does not support it.

### Storage tiering

Memphis offers a multi-tier storage strategy in its open-source version. Memphis
will write messages that reached their end of 1st retention policy to a 2nd
retention policy on object storage like S3 for longer retention time,
potentially infinite, and post-streaming analysis. This feature can
significantly help with cost reduction and stream auditing.

RabbitMQ does not support it.

### Notifications

In RabbitMQ, notifications are made possible using AlertManager and Cluster
operator, including slack notifications of different metrics like undelivered
messages, resource issues, lags, performance, connections issues, and more.

Memphis has a built-in notification center that can push real-time alerts based
on defined triggers like client disconnections, resource depletion, schema
violation, and more.
