## What is a consumer?

A consumer is a client that reads data or messages from the broker or, more
specifically, from the station.

As the user configures a client connection to Memphis, it comprises several
objects:

- Connection - An open socket between the client to Memphis. Only required once
  as the client/application gets initialized for the first time.

- Consumer - A consumer entity must be declared to read data/messages from
  Memphis.

- (And/or) Producer - A producer entity must be declared to write data/messages
  into Memphis.

### Broker Data Format

Memphis started from NATS which receives, stores, and sends data in binary
format for performance, format alignment, and efficient memory allocations.

When consumers consume messages to Memphis station, they should be converted
from binary to string or any other type needed.

An example from the `node.js` SDK using `.getData().toString()` \-

```
consumer.on('message', (message) => {
  let msg = message.getData().toString();
  message.ack();
});
```

### Parameters

(\*) Names might be a bit different from one SDK to another. Meanings are the
same.

**Connection**

- `host`: Memphis URL

- `port`: Memphis port

- `username`: Can be root or any other application-type user

- `connectionToken`: The token received when the user created. Will change in
  the future to more robust credentials and authentication system

- `reconnect`: The connection entity will try to reconnect to Memphis in case of
  a disconnection

- `maxReconnect`: Amount of time the client will try to reconnect before backing
  off

- `reconnectIntervalMs`: Time window between one retry to another

- `timeoutMs`: Ability to kill a dead connection after explicit time

**Consumer**

- `stationName`: The name of the station to be connected

- `consumerName`: In a station resolution, each connected consumer must have a
  unique identity

- `consumerGroup`: Explained in detail [here](/memphis/concepts/consumer-group).
  Consumers are grouped under an object called "Consumer group." If not
  specified, a default CG will be created using the _consumerName_

- `pullIntervalMs`: Configured in milliseconds, this parameter defines the
  intervals of each consume operation. For example, if the value is set to 1000,
  it means that every 1000 ms, the consumer will try to pull new messages

- `batchSize`: Defines how many messages will be collected per pull operation

- `batchMaxTimeToWaitMs`: Defines how much time (in milliseconds) the consumer
  should wait for the entire required batch to be collected

- `maxAckTimeMs`: For the consumer to receive the next message, the current one
  must be acknowledged, meaning the consumer is ready to consume and handle the
  next message. Oftentimes, the consumer gets crashed/throws an exception / not
  able to handle the message. The `_maxAckTimeMs_`ensure that until X
  millisecond Memphis has not received ACK, it will automatically retransmit the
  message. If not configured correctly, it can result in a duplicate processing

- `maxMsgDeliveries`: The number of times Memphis will retransmit the same
  message to the same consumer

- `caFile`: In case [encrypted client-Memphis](/deployment/kubernetes)
  communication is used. '\<rootCA.pem\>'

- `certFile`: In case [encrypted client-Memphis](/deployment/kubernetes)
  communication is used. '\<cert-client.pem\>'

- `keyFile`: In case [encrypted client-Memphis](/deployment/kubernetes)
  communication is used. '\<key-client.pem\>'

### Offsets

The offset is a simple integer number that is used by Memphis to maintain the
current position of a consumer group. The current offset (just like disk offset)
is a pointer to the last record that Memphis has already sent to a consumer
group in its most recent poll. So, the consumer group doesn't get the same
record twice because of the current offset.

While in most messaging systems, it is the client's responsibility to track the
read offsets, in Memphis, the broker and SDK communicate with each other and
record the acknowledged offsets automatically for the client. If needed, a
specific offset can be used to re-read an acknowledged message.
