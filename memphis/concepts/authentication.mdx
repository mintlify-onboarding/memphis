This document describes authentication and authorisation features in Memphis.
Together they allow the operator to control access to the system.

## The Basics

Memphis has two types of credentials:

- **Application**. Every connection has an associated user and a connection
  token which is authenticated. App credentials includes username, connection
  token, and (optionally) client certificate\* are specified at connection
  initiation time. There is a **default pair of credentials** called the root
  user and its detailes will appear on the post-installation notes.

- **Management**. For management purposes only, and to allow control over the UI
  and CLI, not data, a dedicated user can be created.

<Warning>

**Production environments** should not use the default user and create new user
accounts with generated credentials instead.

</Warning>
