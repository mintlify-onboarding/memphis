## What is a producer?

A producer is the source application/service that pushes data or messages to the
broker or more specifically, to the station.

As the user configures a client connection to Memphis, it comprises several
objects

- Connection - An open socket between the client to Memphis. Only required once
  as the client/application gets initialized for the first time.

- Producer - A producer entity must be declared to write data/messages into
  Memphis.

- (And/Or) Consumer - A consumer entity must be declared to read data/messages
  from Memphis.

### Broker Data Format

Memphis started from NATS which receives, stores, and sends data in binary
format for performance, format alignment, and efficient memory allocations.

When a producer produces messages to Memphis station, they should be converted
into binary.

An example from the `node.js` SDK using `Buffer.from` \-

```
await producer.produce({
  message: Buffer.from("Message: Hello world"),
});
```

### Parameters

(\*) Names might be a bit different from one SDK to another. Meanings are the
same.

**Connection**

- `host`: Memphis URL

- `port`: Memphis port

- `username`: Can be root or any other application-type user

- `connectionToken`: The token received when the user created. Will change in
  the future to more robust credentials and authentication system

- `reconnect`: The connection entity will try to reconnect to Memphis in case of
  a disconnection

- `maxReconnect`: Amount of time the client will try to reconnect before backing
  off

- `reconnectIntervalMs`: Time window between one retry to another

- `timeoutMs`: Ability to kill a dead connection after explicit time

- `keyFile`: In case [encrypted client-Memphis](/deployment/kubernetes)
  communication is used. '\<key-client.pem\>'

- `certFile`: In case [encrypted client-Memphis](/deployment/kubernetes)
  communication is used. '\<cert-client.pem\>'

- `caFile`: In case [encrypted client-Memphis](/deployment/kubernetes)
  communication is used. '\<rootCA.pem\>'

**Producer**

- `stationName`: The name of the station to be connected

- `producerName`: In a station resolution, each connected producer must have a
  unique identity

## Scale considerations

A producer is a logical entity that writes data to a Memphis station. By adding
more producers, the throughput will be increased accordingly due to the
additional writers.
