title: "Message broker"
description: "A message broker is a software that implements an architectural pattern for message transportation,
transformation, and routing."
---

It mediates communication among applications, minimizing the mutual awareness
that applications should have of each other in order to be able to exchange
messages, effectively implementing decoupling.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of a broker is to take incoming messages from applications
and perform some action on them. Message brokers can decouple end-points, meet
specific non-functional requirements, and facilitate the reuse of intermediary
functions. For example, a message broker may be used to manage a workload queue
or message queue for multiple receivers, providing reliable storage, guaranteed
message delivery, and transaction management.

How applications communicate is becoming an increasingly large challenge. Using
messaging middleware simplifies this challenge and allows for a common
communications infrastructure that grows and scales to meet the most demanding
conditions

### Differences between Broker, Pub/Sub, Queue

A message broker is a software component that passes messages between two
systems. A queue is a data structure that can store messages and pass them to
the application when they are ready. A pub/sub system is used to publish and
subscribe to events.

**Message Broker (Memphis)**

A message broker is an intermediary between two applications or services. It
accepts requests from one application or service, processes them and returns
responses back to the requester. The main purpose of a message broker is to
decouple services from each other by handling communication between them.

**Queues**

A queue is a data structure used for storing messages/events in order of arrival
until they can be processed by an application/service. Queues are useful for
decoupling components in distributed systems because they allow asynchronous
processing of messages through multiple nodes in the system â€” hence allowing us
to scale our applications easily.

**Publish-Subscribe System**

A publish-subscribe system (also known as Pub-Sub) allows you to automatically
route information throughout your application based on rules defined by
publishers and subscribers (instead of having direct connections between
publishers and subscribers).
