## Introduction

As memphis started from NATS, it was natural to support NATS SDKs as well. 

The added motivation is -

* To enable Memphis users to enjoy the broad reach and integrations of the NATS ecosystem.

* To enable NATS users to make use of Memphis without code changes

## Limitations

* NATS SDKs version - Compatibility with NATS 2.9 and above.

* Without Memphis SDK, the following Memphis features will be disabled:  
   * Producers/Consumers observability  
   * Schemaverse

## Requirements

Memphis operates at the stream level. For a NATS "subject" to be seen and managed by Memphis, it must first be wrapped by a stream.

For example:

```
nats stream add  -s :6666 --user=:: 
? Stream Name argo_event_source
? Subjects foo
? Storage file
? Replication 3
? Retention Policy Limits
? Discard Policy Old
? Stream Messages Limit -1
? Per Subject Messages Limit -1
? Total Stream Size -1
? Message TTL -1
? Max Message Size -1
? Duplicate tracking time window 2m0s
? Allow message Roll-ups No
? Allow message deletion Yes
? Allow purging subjects or the entire stream Yes
Stream argo_event_source was created
```
