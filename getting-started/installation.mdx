## What is Memphis?

**Memphis** is a next-generation alternative to traditional message brokers.

A simple, robust, and durable cloud-native message broker wrapped with an entire
ecosystem that enables cost-effective, fast, and reliable development of modern
queue-based use cases.

Memphis enables the building of modern queue-based applications that require
large volumes of streamed and enriched data, modern protocols, zero ops, rapid
development, extreme cost reduction, and a significantly lower amount of dev
time for data-oriented developers and data engineers.

**Memphis focuses on four pillars -**

1. Developer Experience - Rapid Development, Modularity, inline processing,
   Schema management.

2. Observability - Reduces troubleshooting time to near zero.

3. Performance and Efficiency - Provide good performance while maintaining
   efficient resource consumption.

4. Stability - Queues and brokers play a critical part in the modern
   application's structure and should be highly available and stable as
   possible.
