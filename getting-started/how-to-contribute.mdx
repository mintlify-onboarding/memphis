## Why should you become a contributor?

Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build
experience in just about any skill you can imagine.

Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or
organizing, if you’re looking for practice, there’s a task for you on an
open-source project.

## Getting started

### 1\. Establish a local memphis environment

0\. Join to Memphis [discord](https://discord.gg/WZpysvAeTf) channel

1\. Install [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)

2\. Fork Memphis [broker](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis-broker)

3\. Clone the forked repo to your local station

4\. Run a local memphis-mongodb using docker

```
curl -s https://memphisdev.github.io/memphis-docker/docker-compose-mongo.yml -o docker-compose-mongo.yml && docker compose -f docker-compose-mongo.yml -p memphis up
```

5\. Install broker dependencies - enter the cloned directory and run

```
go get -d -v .
```

6\. Run the broker in debug mode (If you're using vscode, click F5) or run via
terminal via:

```
DEV_ENV="true" DOCKER_ENV="true" MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/maindb?retryWrites=true&w=majority" ROOT_PASSWORD="memphis" CONNECTION_TOKEN="memphis" ANALYTICS="false" LOGS_RETENTION_IN_DAYS="30" JWT_SECRET="JWT_TEST_PURPOSE" REFRESH_JWT_SECRET="REFRESH_JWT_TEST_PURPOSE" go run main.go --js --auth memphis --websocket_no_tls
```

#### Frontend Contributions

1\. The source files of the UI can be found in a directory called
״[ui_src](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis-broker/tree/master/ui%5Fsrc)״

2\. Navigate to "ui_src" dir

3\. Install dependencies by running `npm install`

4\. Run the UI locally by running `npm start`

5\. Start coding! Here are some
["Good first issues"](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis-broker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

6\. Once done - push your code and create a pull request to merge your updates
with memphis main repo

#### Backend Contributions

Once you have
established[ memphis dev environment](/getting-started/how-to-contribute#getting-started),
you can start coding.

Memphis backend opportunities are -

1. Memphis Broker

2. SDKs: [Python](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis.py),
   [Go](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis.go),
   [Node.js](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis.js), or
   [future SDKs](https://github.com/orgs/memphisdev/projects/2/views/1?filterQuery=label%3A%22epic%3A+sdk%22)

3. [Memphis CLI](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis-cli)

Grab a
["Good first issue"](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis-broker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22),
and once done - push your changes and open a "pull request"

#### Data Engineer

As a data engineer, it would be great to get your feedback, potential use cases,
QA, and push memphis to the limit in terms of data workloads would be an amazing
contribution, as at the end of the day, you are our champion!

#### DevOps

As a DevOps engineer, you can find multiple paths of contribution

1. [Helm deployment](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis-k8s)

2. [Terraform](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis-terraform)

3. [Docker](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis-docker)

4. DevOps
   [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/memphisdev/projects/2/views/1?filterQuery=label%3A%22epic%3A+deployment%22)
