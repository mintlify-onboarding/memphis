### Introduction

[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) is one of the world's three
most popular cloud providers. It offers a high-performance infrastructure for
cloud computing, data analytics & machine learning. Secure, reliable, and
high-performance cloud services.

At the moment, memphis utilizing [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to
automate the entire deployment process from VPC creation, to K8S, to memphis
deployment.

Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files.

### Prerequisites

- A [GCP Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

- A [GCP Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) \+ GCP
  [Service Account Key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#iam-service-account-keys-create-console)

- gcloud SDK + CLI [installed](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts),
  configuration depends on station OS.

- Authorize the SDK to access GCP using your user account credentials

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

- Enable API services:

```
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

```
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com
```

- [Adjust the "N2_CPUS"](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quota) quota according to
  your region. (Default is 8, increase to at least 12)

- Terraform is
  [installed](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/aws-get-started)

- Kubectl is
  [installed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

- helm is [installed](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

### Step 0: Clone Memphis-Terraform repo

```
git clone git@github.com:memphisdev/memphis-terraform.git && \
cd memphis-terraform/GCP/GKE
```

### Step 1: Deploy GKE Cluster using Terraform

<Info>**In this step, you will need your** `**projectID**`**.**</Info>

```bash
make infra
```

<Info>
  Memphis uses "`makefile`" instead of running three terraform commands
</Info>
### Step 2: Deploy Memphis

```bash
make cluster
```

Once deployment is complete, the Memphis Load Balancer URL will be revealed.

### Step 3: Login to Memphis

Display memphis load balancer public IP by running the following -

```
kubectl get svc -n memphis
```

The UI will be available through **https://\<Public IP\>:9000**

### Appendix A: Clean (Remove) Memphis Terraform deployment

Destroy Memphis App -

```bash
make destroymemphis
```

<Info>**It might take a few minutes for the ALB to be deleted.**</Info>

Destroy Memphis GKE Cluster -

```bash
make destroyinfra
```
