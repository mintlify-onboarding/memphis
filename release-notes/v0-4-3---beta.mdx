Please make sure your **SDKs** are **updated** to the latest version to enjoy

### ‚ú® Added features

- [DLS](/memphis/concepts/dead-letter) (dead-letter station) now supports
  storing messages that violate an attached schema. Stored message types can be
  controlled via triggers.

- Schemaverse now supports
  [GraphQL](https://docs.memphis.dev/memphis/memphis/schemaverse-schema-management/formats/graphql).

- Schemaverse users using Go SDK can send
  [protobuf](/memphis/schemaverse/getting-started/protobuf) messages by sending
  map\[string\]interface{} type, **without storing the schemas locally.**

- [NATS compatibility](/sdks-and-protocols/nats). Memphis is now compatible with
  all NATS SDKs.

- REST (HTTP proxy) logs are now exposed in the logs section.

- Cluster configuration. Shape your cluster configuration directly from Memphis
  GUI.

- Attach schema to a station using the SDKs.

- HTTP proxy. Generate access tokens with a dynamic expiration time.

- Ability to filter system logs by type.

### üìà Enhancements

- Improved broker memory utilization.

- Improved real-time GUI rendering.

- Broker performance improvements.

- Node.js SDK (0.4.8)

- Go SDK (0.1.8)

- Python SDK (0.2.7)

### üêõ Fixed bugs

- Air-gapped environments - Broken links in the GUI might appear - fixed.

- When sending messages to a deleted station via the HTTP proxy, an error
  returned ‚ÄúMemphis: no responders available for request‚Äù - fixed

- Async produce didn‚Äôt work in Python SDK - fixed

### üòî Known issues

- Authentication - Application-type users connect with Memphis (via the SDKs)
  using a connection token. For now, this token is constant and randomly
  generated per Memphis deployment.

- While using an older SDK version, an error message appears on the station
  overview page saying ‚ÄúError while getting notified about a poison message:
  Missing mandatory message headers.‚Äù

- When storage capacity reaches 100%, Memphis GUI becomes unresponsive till
  cleaned up by at least 10%.

- Stations/producers/consumers might appear without the user who created them.

- Resending/dropping a great amount of dead-letter messages can significantly
  take time.

- RAFT-related logs content is being trimmed.
