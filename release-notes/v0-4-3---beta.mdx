* Schemaverse now supports [GraphQL](https://docs.memphis.dev/memphis/memphis/schemaverse-schema-management/formats/graphql).

* Schemaverse users using Go SDK can send [protobuf](/memphis/memphis/schemaverse-schema-management/getting-started/protobuf) messages by sending map\[string\]interface{} type, **without storing the schemas locally.**

* [NATS compatibility](/memphis/sdks-and-protocols/nats). Memphis is now compatible with all NATS SDKs.

* REST (HTTP proxy) logs are now exposed in the logs section.

* Cluster configuration. Shape your cluster configuration directly from Memphis GUI.

* Attach schema to a station using the SDKs.

* HTTP proxy. Generate access tokens with a dynamic expiration time.

* Ability to filter system logs by type.

![:bug:](/images)

 Fixed bugs

* Async produce didn’t work in Python SDK - fixed

### 

![:pensive:](/images)

 Known issues

* Authentication - Application-type users connect with Memphis (via the SDKs) using a connection token. For now, this token is constant and randomly generated per Memphis deployment.

* While using an older SDK version, an error message appears on the station overview page saying “Error while getting notified about a poison message: Missing mandatory message headers.”

* When storage capacity reaches 100%, Memphis GUI becomes unresponsive till cleaned up by at least 10%.

* Stations/producers/consumers might appear without the user who created them.

* Resending/dropping a great amount of dead-letter messages can significantly take time.

* RAFT-related logs content is being trimmed.
