Please make sure your **SDKs** are **updated** to the latest version to enjoy
new features

### ‚ú® Added features

- Real-time cluster resources monitoring, including CPU, memory, storage, and
  throughput.

- Station indicator of whether there are active producers/consumers.

- Establish a secured client connection over TLS.

- SDKs have the ability to pass `context objects` to the consumer
  `message handler` function.

- Consume messages from a specific sequence number (offset).

- Get the message sequence number.

- Python SDK clients can produce messages as a `dictionary`.

- Node.js SDK clients can produce messages as a `JS object`.

- Node.js SDK users can produce headers as a `JS object`.

- Broker performance improvements.

- Node.js SDK (0.4.9)

- Go SDK (0.2.0)

- Python SDK (0.2.9)

### üêõ Fixed bugs

- Stations/producers/consumers might appear without the user who created them.

- RAFT-related logs content is being trimmed.

- The "Total messages" counter was sometimes wrong on the UI main overview page.

- Node.js SDK - consumers got messages in a broken format.

- Stations with dead-letter messages appeared with a wrong indication of "There
  are no dead-letter messages"

### üòî Known issues

- Authentication - Application-type users connect with Memphis (via the SDKs)
  using a connection token. For now, this token is constant and randomly
  generated per Memphis deployment.

- While using an older SDK version, an error message appears on the station
  overview page saying, ‚ÄúError while getting notified about a poison message:
  Missing mandatory message headers.‚Äù

- When storage capacity reaches 100%, Memphis GUI becomes unresponsive till
  cleaned up by at least 10%.

- Resending/dropping a great amount of dead-letter messages can significantly
  take time.
