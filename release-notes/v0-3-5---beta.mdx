### ✨ Added features

- Python SDK!

- "1-click" deployment over DigitalOcean K8S cluster

- Typescript support

- NestJS support

- When opening Memphis UI for the first time, users can create their first
  management user directly.

- General improvements

### 📈 Enhancements

- Client connections (SDKs) no longer have to send three different ports (data
  port, TCP port, management port) to connect with Memphis, now all you to do is
  to send one port, which defaults to 6666

- A new version of Node.js SDK (0.4.0), which includes NestJS support

- A new version of Go SDK (0.1.3)

- Smaller image size

### 🐛 Fixed bugs

- The client TCP connection is now secured and more stable

- Reconnect flow of clients is now stable

- Root user appears twice - fixed

- Factories/Stations appear more than once - fixed

- CLI is having issues getting a list of producers/consumers - fixed

### 😔 Known issues

- Authentication - users of type “Application” connect with Memphis (via the
  SDKs) using a connection-token. For now, this token is constant and randomly
  generated per Memphis deployment

- For users using an old version of the SDKs, an error message is popped on the
  station overview page saying “Error while getting notified about a poison
  message: Missing mandatory message headers”

- Stations with retention type “memory” sometimes stuck and appears although
  they are no longer exist

- Producers/Consumers stay “connected” in the UI in case of broker failure
  during client connection
