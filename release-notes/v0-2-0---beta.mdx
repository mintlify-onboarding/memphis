### üêõ Fixed bugs

- Only users from type applications can connect with Memphis (SDK connection) -
  Now also the root user can connect via the SDKs.

- System logs are not persistent - logs persist inside Memphis's internal DB for
  30 days

- Zombie resources (connections/producers/consumers) caused by downtime of an
  application connected to Memphis / downtime of Memphis during an active
  connection with an application - We've added a background task responsible to
  clean those zombie resources.

- Producers/consumers connected to a Station that has been deleted are not
  getting disconnected automatically - fixed

### üòî Known issues

- Authentication - users from type applications connect with Memphis (via the
  SDKs) using a connection token. For now, this token is constant per Memphis
  environment.

- System components - UI service appears as unhealthy
